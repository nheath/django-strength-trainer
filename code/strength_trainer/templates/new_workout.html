                    <strong>Congratulations!</strong> You have completed the 4 week workout cycle
                    It is suggested that you increase your 1 Rep Max by 10 lbs for leg workouts
                    and 5 lbs for upper body. I have taken the liberty of doing that automatically
                    based on your previous workout's 1 Rep Max's. I recommend sticking to these gradual 
                    increases unless you failed to complete the last cycles workouts adequately.
                    If that is the case subtract 10 from the squat the deadlift, and 5 from overhead 
                    and bench and try again. Good luck and keep up the hard work!
                </p>

                    The 5/3/1 workout focuses on what many would call the core lifts. All that is needed is your to construct your personalized plan
                     is your 1 rep max for each of the core lifts. <br>1 rep max = the most weight that <strong>right</strong> now you could lift.
                </br>

                    More about the workout <br>Developed by Jim Wendler. This program was designed to increase
                    functional strength gains that could be sustained over a long period of time. Inspired after years of powerlifting
                    Jim realized he was strong but not very functional. His passion to continue to lift but his desire to have functional
                    strength lead to 5-3-1.New lifters looks at a program like this and think its too "slow" or "light. But it is a slow
                    progressive approach that makes this program something you can do for years and continue to get results.
